## ESM-2

ESM-2 is a state-of-the-art protein model trained on a masked language modelling objective. It is suitable for fine-tuning on a wide range of tasks that take protein sequences as input. For detailed information on the model architecture and training data, please refer to the [accompanying paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.07.20.500902v2). You may also be interested in some demo notebooks ([PyTorch](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/protein_language_modeling.ipynb), [TensorFlow](https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/examples/protein_language_modeling-tf.ipynb)) which demonstrate how to fine-tune ESM-2 models on your tasks of interest.

Several ESM-2 checkpoints are available in the Hub with varying sizes. Larger sizes generally have somewhat better accuracy, but require much more memory and time to train:
